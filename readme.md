# 📊 Data Analysis with Python

Welcome to this repository dedicated to data analysis using Python! 🐍

This project focuses on exploring and modeling two distinct datasets: the California housing data and the concrete compressive strength data.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

-   **Project 1**: Analysis of California Housing Data.
-   **Project 2**: Analysis of Concrete Compressive Strength Data.
-   **Project 3**: Advanced Analysis of Concrete Compressive Strength Data.

## 🏡 Project 1: California Housing Data Analysis

In this project, we leverage the *California Housing Dataset* available within the `scikit-learn` library. This dataset comprises 20,640 samples, each characterized by 8 features that describe various demographic and geographic aspects of districts in California. The primary objective is to **predict the median house value** across these districts.

**Dataset Features**:

-   `MedInc`: Median income in block group
-   `HouseAge`: Median house age
-   `AveRooms`: Average number of rooms per household
-   `AveBedrms`: Average number of bedrooms per household
-   `Population`: Population of block group
-   `AveOccup`: Average household size
-   `Latitude`: Geographical latitude
-   `Longitude`: Geographical longitude

## 🏗️ Projects 2 & 3: Concrete Compressive Strength Analysis

These projects are based on a dataset sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes 1,030 samples representing concrete mixtures, detailing their components, age, and measured **compressive strength**.

**Dataset Features**:

-   `Cement` (kg/m³)
-   `Blast Furnace Slag` (kg/m³)
-   `Fly Ash` (kg/m³)
-   `Water` (kg/m³)
-   `Superplasticizer` (kg/m³)
-   `Coarse Aggregate` (kg/m³)
-   `Fine Aggregate` (kg/m³)
-   `Age` (days)
-   `Concrete compressive strength` (MPa)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   **Programming Language**: Python 🐍
-   **Libraries**:
    -   `pandas` 📊
    -   `numpy` 🔢
    -   `matplotlib` 🎨
    -   `seaborn` 📈
    -   `scikit-learn` 🤖

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

-   Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on both datasets.
-   Develop predictive models to estimate house values and concrete compressive strength.
-   Evaluate and interpret the performance of these models.
